prototyper:

ADVANCED TOPICS:
- needs coupling with online hosting to upload excel files (< might have to resort to Steam Workshop if no licensing)
- needs some kind of license model (< this might not be allowed)


TODO:
- support column-header text instead of row text
- support auto-loading icons through text
- support bags in bags
- support 'ignore' content type for areas, which just copies over the old area (to allow custom drawing on images, without losing it)
  - include a warn + make backup if dimensions change, as it won't look pretty
- support 'image' content type which loads an image from the image directory
- shuffle decks/bags when the game is loaded
- collect all parsing errors (as far as possible) and list them together
- allow dealing deck parts to new positions (such as player hand, or two draw stacks)
- allow object tracking when rebuilding (so player re-positioning is remembered, where possible) ?
- saving items to component chest?
- create a TTS image for the load file created
- allow saving as a new version instead of overwriting

- allow changing basic room settings (table model) ?

- automate documentation?
- unit tests
- actual website
  - donate button
  - download binaries
  - docs
