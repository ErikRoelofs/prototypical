prototyper:

BASIC:
- needs a specifically defined excel format	(few hours)
- needs a GUI tool to pick a file and a storage folder (few hours)
- needs an Excel importer library to read the file (few hours)
- needs to do a ton of parsing to convert the Excel file to domain info (weeks?)
- needs a JSON writing library to convert the domain info to a TTS save file (days?)
- needs image drawing/saving abilities (days?)




ADVANCED:
- needs coupling with online hosting to upload excel files
- needs to load the files on the server
- needs support for on-the-fly image generation (and a "reload" button that drops the cache)
- (needs to output a save file with web-based links)
- needs some kind of license model


EXCEL FORMAT:
V- complex-types (name, size, shape, bg-color, backside)
V- shapes (pretty much freeform sizes; use column letters (starting with C) + 0)
V- complex-data (name, type-name, [content columns])
V- decks (name, card identifiers)
V- tokens/markers (cubes, cylinders, triangles, coins, tokens) (name, shape, size, front-color, front-content, back-color?, back-content? )
V- dice (name, color, sides, content?)
V- playing field content (number of sectors, content per sector)



PROOF OF CONCEPT:
VVV!!!- convert an excel file with some default markers into an importable save file
