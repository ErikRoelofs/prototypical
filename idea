prototyper:

BASIC:
- needs a specifically defined excel format
- needs a GUI tool to pick a file and a storage folder
- needs an Excel importer library to read the file
- needs to do a ton of parsing to convert the Excel file to domain info
- needs a JSON writing library to convert the domain info to a TTS save file
- needs image drawing/saving abilities




ADVANCED:
- needs coupling with online hosting to upload excel files (< might have to resort to Steam Workshop if no licensing)
- needs to load the files on the server
- needs support for on-the-fly image generation (and a "reload" button that drops the cache < this cannot be done)
- (needs to output a save file with web-based links)
- needs some kind of license model (< this might not be allowed)


EXCEL FORMAT:
V- complex-types (name, size, shape, bg-color, backside)
V- shapes (pretty much freeform sizes; use column letters (starting with C) + 0)
V- complex-data (name, type-name, [content columns])
V- decks (name, card identifiers)
V- tokens/markers (cubes, cylinders, triangles, coins, tokens) (name, shape, size, front-color, front-content, back-color?, back-content? )
V- dice (name, color, sides, content?)
V- playing field content (number of sectors, content per sector)



PROOF OF CONCEPT:
VVV!!!- convert an excel file with some default markers into an importable save file


Some todo:
- support bags in bags
- support 'ignore' content type for areas, which just copies over the old area (to allow custom drawing on images, without losing it)
  - include a warn + make backup if dimensions change, as it won't look pretty
- support 'image' content type which loads an image from the image directory
- shuffle decks/bags when the game is loaded
- collect all parsing errors (as far as possible) and list them together
- allow dealing deck parts to new positions (such as player hand, or two draw stacks)
- allow object tracking when rebuilding (so player re-positioning is remembered, where possible) ?
- saving items to component chest?
- create a TTS image for the load file created
- allow saving as a new version instead of overwriting

- allow changing basic room settings (table model) ?

- automate documentation?
- unit tests
- actual website
  - donate button
  - download binaries
  - docs
